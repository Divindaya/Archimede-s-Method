# Archimede-s-Method
A simulation of Archimede's mathematical algorithm of using geometry to find the upper and lower bounds of pi

Mathematical pi - is a mathematical constant also referred to as Archimede's Constant. Pi is defined in Euclidean geometry as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter (Wikipedia)

Archimede's method calculates a lower and upper bound for pi by calculating the perimeter of a gon in proportion to a unit circle. Every iteration increases the sides of the gon used to calculate the perimeter:
  The first iteration calculates the upper and lower bounds of the perimeter of a 6-gon (hexagon) in relation to the unit circle.
  The second iteration doubles the sides of the previous gon, in this case, a 12-gon and finds the upper and lower bounds of the perimeter in relation to the unit circle and so on and so forth to whichever value predetermined by input
